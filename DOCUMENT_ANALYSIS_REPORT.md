#### 6.2 Source Reliability Scoring
```javascript
Score sources based on:
- Methodology transparency (disclosed methods = higher score)
- Data sources cited (primary data = higher score)
- Prediction accuracy (track record over time)
- Industry recognition (known analysts = higher score)
- Recency (newer data = higher relevance)
- Completeness (full reports = higher than excerpts)

Display reliability scores with insights
```

#### 6.3 Confidence Scoring
```javascript
Every extracted fact should have confidence score:
- High (0.9-1.0): Explicitly stated with clear context
- Medium (0.7-0.89): Implied or requires minor interpretation
- Low (0.5-0.69): Inferred or ambiguous

Display uncertainty: "Cloud gaming revenue estimated between $2.4B-$3.1B (3 sources, confidence: medium)"

## Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge 1: Inconsistent PDF Formats
**Issue:** Documents have varying structures (presentation vs report vs white paper)

**Mitigation:**
- Multi-strategy extraction (try text, then OCR, then hybrid)
- Format-specific handlers (presentation vs report)
- Confidence scoring to flag poor extractions
- Manual review queue for problematic documents

### Challenge 2: Chart-Heavy Documents
**Issue:** PlayStation report had minimal text, mostly charts

**Mitigation:**
- Implement chart-to-data extraction pipeline
- Use GPT-4V for complex visualizations
- Cross-reference chart data with text mentions
- Store both image and extracted data
- Flag documents for enhanced processing

### Challenge 3: Metric Ambiguity
**Issue:** Same metric described differently ("revenue", "revenues", "total revenue", "rev")

**Mitigation:**
- Standardized metric taxonomy
- Entity normalization layer
- Context-aware metric identification
- Unit conversion and standardization
- Disambiguation through context

### Challenge 4: Temporal Context
**Issue:** "This year", "last quarter", "recent" are ambiguous

**Mitigation:**
- Extract publication date
- Resolve relative dates to absolute dates
- Track fiscal year definitions (companies vary)
- Store both relative and absolute references
- Add temporal context to all extractions

### Challenge 5: Conflicting Data
**Issue:** Different sources report different numbers for same metric

**Mitigation:**
- Track all sources separately
- Note methodology differences
- Provide ranges instead of single values
- Source reliability scoring
- Show variance and confidence intervals

### Challenge 6: Context Loss
**Issue:** Extracting numbers without surrounding context loses meaning

**Mitigation:**
- Always store context window (surrounding text)
- Link to source page and section
- Preserve qualifiers ("projected", "actual", "estimated")
- Track assumptions and conditions
- Enable drill-down to full context
